# [Bhandi](https://bhandi.vercel.app/)

Welcome to **Bhandi** — the project you never knew you needed, but now can’t live without.  
Think of it as your friendly neighborhood helper, except it lives in your repo and doesn’t judge your coding skills (most of the time).

---

## What is Bhandi?
“Bhandi” loosely translates to *that thing you throw all your random stuff into*.  
That’s exactly what this project is:  
- A little bit HTML  
- A pinch of CSS  
- A dash of JavaScript  
- And a lot of questionable decisions  

---

## Features
- Looks good (sometimes) – depends on your screen and your mood.  
- Runs blazing fast – because there’s barely anything to load.  
- Bug-friendly – we don’t remove bugs; we adopt them.  
- Cross-platform – works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and even on your toaster if it has a browser.  

---

## Tech Stack
- HTML (the bones)  
- CSS (the makeup)  
- JavaScript (the chaos gremlin)
